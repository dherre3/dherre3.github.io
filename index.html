	About Me:<br><br>
	My name is David Herrera, I am a student currently finishing my last semester of Computer Science and Physics at McGill University. I have a deep passion for 
	mathematical models that have underlying consequences in the world around us, most specifically I have cultivated an interest in Biophysics. 
	I am currently working on a project that involves a new theory called adaptive sorting to explain the phenomena of synergism in the context of T-cell ligands
	and foreing ligands.<br><br>
	My previous work has included flourecence microscopy where a software called DSpIDA to analyze fluorescent images from a TIRFM was used, and a relationship between 
	the number of fluorecent particles in a molecule vs. the diffusion state (speed) was found in cells transfected with a fluorescent label. 
	In terms of programming I really enjoy thinking about beautiful design whose objective is to make user experience simple and pleasant, I also enjoy thinking about ideas that 
	exploit common human psychology and human patterns.<br> <br>In terms of experience, last summer I worked on a project called CANDLE, which was an effort to transform a MATLAB software that
	performed certain filters and image transformations to neuron images, into an ImageJ plug-in, as the idea was to make the software free and available to anyone.
	For this project we decided to use Jython as the language, and the Java Native Access, as some of the functions were mex files coming from C programs. This project is on the last 
	stages of testing after extensive 8 months of work.<br><br>
	Currently, I have two projects going on, one of them is a game to help with the maping of neurons by gamification. The application is using Java's library LibGDX and the idea is to make it a multiplatform application.
	Lastly I am also interested in web development, the design, the interface, and the functionality by making the different elements and languages work together. I am currently learning Ruby and Ruby on rails and will
	hopefully start a project soon enough.<br><br>
	In my spare time I enjoy playing and watching soccer, running, biking, playing ping pong and reading about inspiring figures such as my personal hero Richard Feynman, and playing video games.
